  <p> This is a screenshot of my first side-scrolling game.<br/> It was initially inspired by Mario but our vision was cut down by the instructions detailed by the assingment. </p>

<h2 title"Week 3"> Robotics Reflections </h2>
<h3 title="Pretty Fun"> 5 July 2017 </h3>
  <p>   Today I realized that robots are ubiquitous. <br/>This made me very nervous because this surge in techological advances will reduce the job market by a very noticable margin. Many jobs will be eliminated due to the surge of new, more affortabe and profitable technological labor. Despite this, I do realize that new technological discoveries can relieve many people of heavy burdens. They can aid those with disabilities and make things easier for people in general. Technological advances will robably lead to many other medically and scientifically significant advances as well. </p>
  <p> Working in groups worked well for me because of the group I was in. It provided multiple perspectives that made working towards a solution more efficient, as opposed to working on a solution by oneself. However, I can easily imagine a scenario where a member or multiple members would not have the chance to work on the robot. Working in smaller groups, I believe, would remedy this issue. </p>

  <p> Manuela Veloso's and Ayanna Howard's work both have qualities that already or could help those with disabilities a lot. Veloso's robots enable disabled children to communicate by combining easy-to-work sensors with iPads or other technologies. Howard's robots' abilities to communicate with one another and adjust to circumstance creates a large range of possiblities in everyday life.</p>
  <p> During the lightshow-project, my group agreed on a pattern fairly quickly and then we worked steadily towards completing our goal. We overcame our struggles with help but I wished that we would have communicated better.</p>
  <p> Every Arduino sketch should have setup() and probably loops(). Using functions and variables is also very helpfu.</p>
