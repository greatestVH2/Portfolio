  <p> This is a screenshot of my first side-scrolling game.<br/> It was initially inspired by Mario but our vision was cut down by the instructions detailed by the assingment. </p>

<h2 title="5 July 2017; Pretty Fun"> Robotics Reflection </h2>
  <p>   Today I realized that robots are ubiquitous. <br/>This made me very nervous because this surge in techological advances will reduce the job market by a very noticable margin. Many jobs will be eliminated due to the surge of new, more affortabe and profitable technological labor. Despite this, I do realize that new technological discoveries can relieve many people of heavy burdens. They can aid those with disabilities and make things easier for people in general. Technological advances will robably lead to many other medically and scientifically significant advances as well. </p>
  <p> Working in groups worked well for me because of the group I was in. It provided multiple perspectives that made working towards a solution more efficient, as opposed to working on a solution by oneself. However, I can easily imagine a scenario where a member or multiple members would not have the chance to work on the robot. Working in smaller groups, I believe, would remedy this issue. </P>
